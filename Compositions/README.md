# Compositions

Potentially useful custom compositions. 

## Usage

Add the compositions by copying these to this folder:

```C:\Users\<your PC account name>\Documents\Arma 3 - Other Profiles\<your Arma 3 profile name>\compositions```

You can then access these in the editor by selecting compositions (a.k.a groups, 2nd option in the top-right), and then the white circular symbol to the right of the faction choices.
