# Templates

Template missions for various terrains. Each one should ideally be named "#2MRB_<terrain>", to keep things consistent. The hash serves to sort them at the top of the list. 

**If the mission was uploaded to the server after your changes, please note this in your commit message by prepending "[U]".**
